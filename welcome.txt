Welcome to IDEasy!
We have automatically installed your local IDE for this project now.
This includes all tools needed for your daily development work as well as plugins needed for your IDEs.
Also git code repositories can be cloned automatically during the setup.

These are the IDE settings for IDEasy itself.
If you want to create your own project based on IDEasy read this documentation:
https://github.com/devonfw/IDEasy/blob/main/documentation/usage.adoc#admin
If you just want to use IDEasy as a developer, you should first switch to your new project

icd IDEasy

(in case you called 'ide create IDEasy -' before)

Then you can start your favourite IDE by typing e.g.

ide intellij

(or 'ide eclipse', 'ide vscode', 'ide android-studio', 'ide pycharm', ...)
For details check the help:

ide help
